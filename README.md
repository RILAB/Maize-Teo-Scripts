#Scripts used to analyze linked selection and demography in maize

Below is a description of each script used in Beissinger et

## Part 1: SFS, Genotype likelihoods, and SNP calling

**fullScript_genic.sh** Computes SFS, 2D-SFS, and diversity info for maize and teosinte in genic regions only.

**fullScript_intergenic.sh** Computes SFS, 2D-SFS, and diversity info for maize and teosinte in intergenic regions only.

**fullScript_WholeGenome.sh** Computes SFS, 2D-SFS, and diversity info for maize and teosinte, genome-wide.

## Part 2: Code to study demography



## Part 2: R code to study selection
